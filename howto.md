# How to Transform Raw Blog Posts into Polished Drafts

This document describes the methodology for transforming raw blog posts (often voice-transcribed rambling) into polished drafts using the style and structure of the "best" blog post as a template.

## Overview of the Pipeline

```
raw/ -> drafts/ -> published/
```

1. **Raw**: Stream-of-consciousness content, often voice-transcribed, contains core ideas but lacks structure
2. **Draft**: Structured, polished, applies the "best" post style template
3. **Published**: Final edits, tightened prose, minor clarifications

## Analysis: What Goes Right and Wrong in Transformations

### What Went RIGHT (preserve these)
- Adding an engaging opening hook that addresses the reader directly
- Fixing voice transcription artifacts and verbal tics
- Structuring with clear sections and logical flow
- Adding a proper summary/conclusion
- Making arguments more coherent and polished
- Preserving the author's core voice and ideas

### What Went WRONG (avoid these)
- Leaving passages too verbose
- Losing personal storytelling depth in favor of abstraction
- Insufficient direct reader engagement
- Choppy transitions between sections
- Over-polishing to the point of losing personality

## Key Style Elements from the "Best" Post

The "best" post (how_to_choose_your_grad_school.md) exemplifies these qualities:

### 1. Opening Hook
- Address reader directly: "If you are reading this..."
- Acknowledge their situation and feelings
- Establish credibility briefly
- State what this post is for

**Template:**
```
If you are reading this, you probably [acknowledge their situation].
Maybe you [scenario 1]. Maybe you [scenario 2].
This blog post is for those who want to [what this post delivers].
```

### 2. Framework Introduction Upfront
- Introduce 3-4 named perspectives/frameworks before diving into details
- Give each perspective a memorable name
- Briefly explain each in 1-2 sentences
- State that balancing all perspectives leads to better decisions

**Template:**
```
Before I go into the details, let me briefly introduce [N] perspectives
that will help you think about [topic]: the [Name] Perspective,
the [Name] Perspective, and the [Name] Perspective.

The **[Name] Perspective** [brief explanation].

The **[Name] Perspective** [brief explanation].

The **[Name] Perspective** [brief explanation].

Balancing all [N] perspectives probably leads to better [decisions/outcomes]
than looking at one angle alone.
```

### 3. Table of Contents
- Include a structured table of contents for longer posts
- Helps readers navigate and sets expectations
- Mirrors the framework structure

### 4. Direct Reader Engagement
- Use "you" frequently
- Ask reflection questions throughout
- Include "Do I want to be someone who...?" identity questions
- Anticipate reader objections: "You might think..."

**Examples:**
- "Do I want to be someone who [negative behavior]? No, thanks."
- "Do I want to be someone who [positive behavior]? Yes, please."
- "You might think it is silly that... But really it is not!"

### 5. Personal Anecdotes with Sensory Details
- Include specific, vivid personal stories
- Add sensory details (what you saw, felt, experienced)
- Name specific places, tools, people when appropriate
- Show vulnerability - share failures, not just successes

**Good example from best post:**
```
I remember sitting at his balcony having BBQ and talking about
how to view important problems in life from a perspective of
psychology and computer science.
```

### 6. Vulnerable Honesty
- Share failures openly
- Admit what you don't know
- Discuss struggles and how you coped
- This builds trust and relatability

### 7. Conversational Yet Authoritative Tone
- Speak like a mentor, not a textbook
- Use contractions occasionally
- Maintain expertise without being distant
- Balance informal moments with substantive content

### 8. Philosophical Depth
- Connect practical advice to deeper questions about meaning
- Ask "who do you want to be?" not just "what should you do?"
- Reference the kind of life the reader wants to live
- Avoid being preachy - pose questions rather than dictate answers

### 9. Strong Structure with Subheadings
- Break content into digestible chunks
- Use descriptive subheadings
- Maintain logical flow between sections
- Each section should be able to stand somewhat alone

### 10. Conclusion with Call to Reflection
- Summarize key takeaways briefly
- End with an identity-focused reflection
- Leave reader with something to think about

**Template:**
```
If you take away one thing from this blog post, let it be this: [key insight].

[Brief summary of main points]

Do I want to be someone who [negative pattern]? Or do I want to be
someone who [positive pattern]? I choose the latter, and I hope you will too.
```

## Transformation Checklist

When transforming a raw post to a draft:

- [ ] Read raw post completely, identify core arguments and structure
- [ ] Identify the 3-4 main perspectives/themes that organize the content
- [ ] Write opening hook that addresses reader directly
- [ ] Write framework introduction with named perspectives
- [ ] Create table of contents
- [ ] Restructure content under clear section headings
- [ ] Add direct reader engagement throughout ("you", reflection questions)
- [ ] Enhance personal anecdotes with sensory details
- [ ] Add "Do I want to be..." identity questions at key moments
- [ ] Ensure vulnerable honesty - include failures, not just successes
- [ ] Check transitions between sections
- [ ] Write conclusion with call to reflection
- [ ] Remove voice transcription artifacts and verbal tics
- [ ] Preserve author's core voice - don't over-polish

## What to Preserve from Raw Posts

- Core arguments and insights
- Personal examples and anecdotes
- The author's unique perspective and voice
- Specific details that give authenticity
- Controversial or bold claims (these give character)

## What to Transform

- Stream-of-consciousness structure -> logical flow
- Verbose passages -> tighter prose
- Abstract claims -> concrete examples
- Passive voice -> active voice
- Generic statements -> direct reader address
- Isolated facts -> connected narrative

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-sanitizing**: Don't remove all personality and edge
2. **Adding fluff**: Don't pad with unnecessary words to sound "professional"
3. **Losing the thread**: Keep the core argument visible throughout
4. **Generic advice**: Keep specific, personal, opinionated
5. **Forgetting the reader**: Always write TO someone, not AT them
